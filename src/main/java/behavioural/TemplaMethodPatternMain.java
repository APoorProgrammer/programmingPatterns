	 * in subclasses
	 * 
	 * We are going to use an example about how a template method pattern is used when we have two classes 
	 * represents two concepts nearly.
	 * We create an abstract class named SportEvent which implements the Template Method and will have a 
	 * steps series.
	 * After that, we created two classes BasketballSportEvent and FootballSportEvent each them defines 
	 * specifically each step.
