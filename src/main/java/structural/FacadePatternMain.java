	 * which unified the susbsystems.
	 * 
	 * In our case we are simulating a negotiation between TV platform(the client) which wants to buy 
	 * LaLiga's broadcast's rights
	 * In this example there will be many teams with similar interface and instead of use each them we are going to
	 * create a LaLiga interface which works as a facade between the TV buyer and the teams
