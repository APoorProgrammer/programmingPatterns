 * This pattern allows us to use a class to represent another one.
 * Could be many types of proxies, virtual, remote or protection.
 * 
 * Proxy class wraps another class which have certain previous logic or has a expensive cost to create.
 * 
 * In our example we are going to create a FootballClub class that wants to sign up a FootballPlayer but to do that
 * FootballClub previously has to make a offer and will be the AgentClass(Proxy) if considered it or not to allow
 * FootballPlayer sign to this FootballClub.
